# UsageClaw Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 16, 2026**

## Overview

UsageClaw is a browser extension that helps you monitor your AI API usage. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**UsageClaw does NOT collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.**

### What we store locally:
- Your API keys (stored in Chrome's `chrome.storage.local`)
- Cached usage data (stored temporarily in Chrome's local storage)

### What we access:
- AI provider APIs (OpenAI, DeepSeek, MiniMax) — only to fetch YOUR usage data using YOUR API keys
- These requests go directly from your browser to the provider's API servers

### What we DO NOT do:
- We do NOT send your API keys to any third-party server
- We do NOT collect analytics or telemetry
- We do NOT track your browsing activity
- We do NOT use cookies
- We do NOT have any backend server

## Data Storage

All data is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage. Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data.

## Third-Party Services

The extension communicates directly with the following APIs using your own API keys:
- OpenAI API (api.openai.com)
- DeepSeek API (api.deepseek.com)
- MiniMax API (minimax.io)

No data passes through any intermediary server.

## Changes

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
